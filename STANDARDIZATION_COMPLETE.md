- **scripts/deployment/secure-deploy.sh**: Secure deployment procedures (EXECUTABLE)

### 4. Independent Build Capability ✅
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ PASSING - All TypeScript errors resolved
- **Build Process**: ✅ PASSING - Complete ESM/CJS/DTS build output
- **Security Validation**: ✅ PASSING - No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities detected
- **Module Structure**: ✅ PASSING - Proper library bundling with index files

## 🔒 Enhanced Security Features

### Security Permissions
- **Enhanced Permissions**: Auth-specific security commands (audit, security testing)
- **Restricted Operations**: Blocked dangerous operations (file deletion, secret writes)
- **Security Auditing**: Automated security validation in build process

### Security Commands
```bash
# Security audit
npm run security:audit

# Permission validation
npm run security:permissions

# Authentication flow testing
npm run test:auth-flows

# Comprehensive security test suite
./scripts/test/security-test-suite.sh --full
```

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layer security validation
- **Zero Trust**: Continuous security verification
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access grants
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in data protection

## 🏗️ Build and Test Results

### Build Validation ✅
```
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ ESLint security validation passed
✅ No hardcoded secrets detected
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ Build output validation passed
```
